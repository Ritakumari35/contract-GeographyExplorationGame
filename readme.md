## Project Title
**Geography-based Exploration Game (Smart Contract)**

## Project Description
The Geography-based Exploration Game is a decentralized trivia game built on the Ethereum blockchain. Players are asked geography-related questions, and they submit their answers in an attempt to earn points. The smart contract keeps track of players' scores and allows the owner to add new questions to the game. Players can view their scores and participate in an engaging geography-based exploration experience.

The game ensures fairness by preventing players from submitting multiple answers to the same question. The contract also tracks the total number of players participating in the game.
